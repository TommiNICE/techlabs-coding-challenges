<!-- Good job overall! You responded to all the requirements and also added some of the additional elements we asked for.
  The HTML code is well structured and formatted and I appreciate your comments within the code as well. I'm particularly
  happy to see the consistent inclusion of alt-text in all images.

  As for things to consider for further improvement, I've left more detailed comments throughout the two html files. Generally
  speaking, there are some issues with the semantics and inconsistencies in the hierarchy of elements used. While they might not 
  cause issues with the way the pages are rendered, they might reduce accessibility by interfering with/confusing screen readers
  and similar, and also reduce readability of your code for possible collaborators. Within the browser of your choice, you should
  also be able to right-click -> view page source to see the HTML code with some errors highlighted.

  I'm looking forward to what you will all achieve for the CSS and JavaScript challenges!

  While NOT a concern in the scope of this exercise, I'd recommend getting used to creating a full boilerplate, always. Meta

  VSCode and similar also provide functionality to create the basics for the boilerplate almost automatically.

      Ideally, headers should follow each other in properly descending order - jumping from h1 directly to h2 breaks this convention.
      Understandably, you weren't allowed to use CSS yet so I can imagine that you did this for styling/layout reasons.

      Also be aware that emoji are quite a recent addition to HTML.

    While the prompt mentioned not relying on <div> too much, the following paragraphs would have warrranted being grouped in some
    sort of encompassing element - be it a <div> or something more appropriate or specific such as an <article> or <section> tag.

    Similarly, as you used <header> and <footer>, you could have wrapped the entire main content within a <main> tag to improve
    semantics and understanding of the hierarchy of elements - point in case, I'm not sure if this comment should have come before

    <h2>4. Visiting Germany's most beautiful lakes</h2>
    <p>Visiting the most famous German lakes in autumn is a wonderful idea, regardless of the weather. The vibrant fall foliage around lakes like 
      Königssee, Lake Constance (Bodensee), and Lake Müritz transform the landscape into a picturesque scene. The mix of reds, oranges, and yellows 
      reflected in the clear waters creates a breathtaking view perfect for photography and simply enjoying nature. Autumn is considered the off-season 
      for many tourist destinations, including these lakes. This means you can enjoy the serene beauty of the lakes without the summer crowds. Whether 
      hiking, boating, or just relaxing by the shore, you'll find a more peaceful and intimate experience. Additionally, the cooler weather provides the 
      perfect excuse to cozy up in one of the many lakeside cafes or restaurants. Enjoying a warm drink while enjoying the stunning views can be a 
      delightful experience. Many lakeside towns host autumn festivals, offering local food, music, and crafts!
      Here are some of the most beautiful lakes you can visit:

      Nice to see <figure> and <figcaption>, but sadly the hierarchy gets mixed up. Even within your code as-is, you sometimes have 
      the <li> nested within the <figcaption>, sometimes the other way around. These inconsistencies also sometimes mean that you
      close the containing tag first, then the nested one, which is therefore considered a stray tag. These mix-ups easily happen
      when copying code around or refactoring it, but especially with JavaScript these errors become more and more dangerous.

      Ideally, the <li> should be the direct children of the <ul>, and then within the individual <li> tags would be where you
      house the <figure> and nested <figcaption> tags.
