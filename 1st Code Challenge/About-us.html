      <p>Web Development Participant</p>
      <p>Coming from the field of medicine, I decided to pivot my 
      career towards design and graphics. I enjoy photography and creating illustrations, as well as using tools as Figma 
      and Sketch for amateur UX design. Balancing work with hobbies not only fuels my passion but also ensures that I stay mentally and physically healthy.</p>
